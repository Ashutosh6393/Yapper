## PR Size Guidelines

Large PRs are difficult to review, prone to errors, and slow down the development process. Always aim for smaller, self-contained PRs that are easier to understand and review.

### Size Limits

- **Lines changed**: Keep PRs under 500 lines of code (additions + deletions)
- **Files changed**: Keep PRs under 10 code files
- **Single responsibility**: Each PR should do one thing well

**Note**: These limits apply to code files only. Non-code files like documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md), lock files (yarn.lock, package-lock.json), and auto-generated files are excluded from the count.

### How to Split Large Changes

When a task requires extensive changes, break it into multiple PRs:

1. **By layer**: Separate database/schema changes, backend logic, and frontend UI into different PRs
2. **By feature component**: Split a feature into its constituent parts (e.g., API endpoint PR, then UI PR, then integration PR)
3. **By refactor vs feature**: Do preparatory refactoring in a separate PR before adding new functionality
4. **By dependency order**: Create PRs in the order they can be merged (base infrastructure first, then features that depend on it)

### Examples of Good PR Splits

**Instead of one large "Add booking notifications" PR:**
- PR 1: Add notification preferences schema and migration
- PR 2: Add notification service and API endpoints
- PR 3: Add notification UI components
- PR 4: Integrate notifications into booking flow

**Instead of one large "Refactor calendar sync" PR:**
- PR 1: Extract calendar sync logic into dedicated service
- PR 2: Add new calendar provider abstraction
- PR 3: Migrate existing providers to new abstraction
- PR 4: Add new calendar provider support

### Benefits of Smaller PRs

- Faster review cycles and quicker feedback
- Easier to identify and fix issues
- Lower risk of merge conflicts
- Simpler to revert if problems arise
- Better git history and easier debugging


## Boundaries

### Always do
- Run type check on changed files before committing
- Run relevant tests before pushing
- Follow conventional commits for PR titles
- Run <linting, formatting> before pushing

### Ask first
- Adding new dependencies
- Changes affecting multiple packages
- Deleting files
- Running full build or E2E suites

### Never do
- Commit secrets, API keys, or `.env` files
- Expose `credential.key` in any query
- Use `as any` type casting
- Force push or rebase shared branches
- Modify generated files directly
